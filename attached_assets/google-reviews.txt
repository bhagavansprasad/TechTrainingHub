I got an opportunity from one of the corporate company to undergo training on Python from this institute. It really helped me in gaining deep knowledge on Python and as a result got an offer from couple of companies.
The most important thing I liked about the institute is course content which covers almost all the topics with good examples.
I would like thank Prasad Sir for his valuable lectures and knowledge sharing.

I am a working professional who took Python classes along with which, I had opted basic basic programming classes as well, from Aura. I had enrolled during early 2020 and because of Covid-19 situation, classes were done online during the morning hours.
One of the important call out is that the course content is well structured, tracked and taught in an orderly fashion. I was also given help on the program as a part of my projects.
Thank you, Bhagavan.

Mr.Bhagavan(python trainer) is very patient and amiable towards learners of any level and educational background. He provides explanations of complex theories of python in a manner that is easy to understand and follow. Highly benefited from his comprehensive, well paced/structured learning with python course, aided with rich content and materials. He has an extensive knowledge of the subject and is always ready to answer any queries. Finally I would recommend aspirants to approach Aura Networks for a good python training.

I am a mechanical engineer who wants to shift my career to IT and I don't have any prior programming knowledge, but the way Bhagavan sir introduced the subject to me was really awesome, now I am even able to automate and debug the things using python.

ABOUT COURSE :

The structure, of course, make beginners get into python who don't have any programming knowledge and extremely useful to quickly and efficiently learn python from basics to advance level

I personally had a very good time with AURA NETWORKS
Thank you Bhagavan sir for helping me to gain good programming skills
